# LG_2-6_fluxes-with-stable-moduli
Flux solutions with full moduli stabilization and without the need for higher order corrections. We provide lists of phenomenologically interesting Type IIB flux vacua which are based on a particular Landau-Ginzburg (LG) orientifold model: 2^6 containing no Kahler moduli (i.e. is non-geometric).
