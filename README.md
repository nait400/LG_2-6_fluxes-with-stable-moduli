# Landau-Ginzburg ${\small 2^{\scriptscriptstyle 6}}$ : Fluxes with stable moduli
Flux solutions with full moduli stabilization and without the need for higher order corrections. We provide lists of phenomenologically interesting Type IIB flux vacua which are based on a particular Landau-Ginzburg (LG) orientifold model: $2^6$ containing no Kahler moduli (i.e. is non-geometric). 

This repository is intended as a supplement to the results presented in "*Tadpole conjecture
in non-geometric backgrounds*"[[1]](#1), [2407.XXXXX](link). It may also be a potential starting point for anyone interested in learning more and/or working with these models. 

## Phenomenologically interesting solutions
Those who are interested in obtaining the list of flux solutions leading to supersymmetric Minkowski vacua with **all moduli stabilized** (i.e. where all scalar fields become massive) can find those in the following directory '[/fluxes/full-stabilization](/fluxes/full-stabilization)'. Further information about those files can be found in the parent directory.

## Integral flux lattice
A basis of *mostly short* flux vectors spanning a 180-dimensional integer lattice can be found in '[/integral-basis](/integral-basis)'. This linearly independent set of vectors generates a supersymmetric Minkowski flux lattice which can be used as a computational faster tool for exploring the lattice. Further details of the "level-by-level" strategy can be found in the paper.

## Constructing the $2^6$ LG model
We provide the code used for constructing this particular orientifold of the $2^6$ Landau-Ginzburg model here '[/model-construction](\model-construction)'. Comments are included but requires downloading the notebook and viewing in a Mathematica environment.
